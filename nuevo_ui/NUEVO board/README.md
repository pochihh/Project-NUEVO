## Configuration & Jumpers

### 1. Servo Power Jumper (PCA9685)

**JP_SERVO_PWR (PCA9685 Power Enable):**
- **Jumper CLOSED (installed):** Servo rail power connected directly to PCA9685 VCC
  - **Benefit:** No external power cable needed for PCA9685 module
  - **Use case:** Standard setup when using on-board servo power
- **Jumper OPEN (removed):** PCA9685 powered externally
  - **Use case:** When using separate servo power supply or troubleshooting

**Default:** Jumper CLOSED (most common configuration)

**⚠️ Note:** The servo rail voltage is adjustable (5-10V via POT_SERVO). Ensure PCA9685 and connected servos can handle the selected voltage before enabling this jumper.

### 2. Limit Switch Voltage Selection

**JP_LIM_V (All 8 limit switch connectors share this setting):**
- **Position 1-2 (5V):** Use for 5V sensors (mechanical switches, 5V optical endstops)
- **Position 2-3 (3.3V):** Use for 3.3V sensors (some Hall effect, low-voltage proximity sensors)

**Default:** 5V (suitable for mechanical switches and most common optical endstops)

### 3. Stepper Microstepping Configuration

**Each stepper driver has 3 jumpers (MS1, MS2, MS3):**

**Microstepping Table (A4988 and DRV8825):**

| JP_MS1 | JP_MS2 | JP_MS3 | A4988 Mode | DRV8825 Mode |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Open   | Open   | Open   | Full step  | Full step    |
| Closed | Open   | Open   | 1/2 step   | 1/2 step     |
| Open   | Closed | Open   | 1/4 step   | 1/4 step     |
| Closed | Closed | Open   | 1/8 step   | 1/8 step     |
| Closed | Closed | Closed | 1/16 step  | 1/32 step    |

**Recommended Microstepping Settings:**
- **1/16 microstepping (A4988):** Smooth motion, good for most applications
- **1/8 microstepping:** Balance between smoothness and speed
- **Full step:** Maximum speed, used for rapid positioning

**Jumper Configuration:**
- Jumper CLOSED = Insert jumper cap (shorted)
- Jumper OPEN = Remove jumper cap

---

**Current Limit Configuration (Vref Adjustment):**

Each stepper driver has a small potentiometer (Vref pot) to adjust the current limit. **Always set current limit before connecting motors** to prevent overheating.

**A4988 Current Limit:**
```
Current Limit (A) = Vref (V) / (8 × Rsense)

For A4988 with Rsense = 0.1Ω (most common):
Current Limit (A) = Vref (V) / 0.8
```

**DRV8825 Current Limit:**
```
Current Limit (A) = Vref (V) / (5 × Rsense)

For DRV8825 with Rsense = 0.1Ω (typical):
Current Limit (A) = Vref (V) / 0.5
```

**How to Set Vref:**
1. Power on the board (no motor connected yet)
2. Measure voltage between Vref potentiometer wiper and GND with multimeter
3. Adjust potentiometer slowly with small screwdriver
4. Set Vref to desired value based on motor current rating

**Example Vref Settings:**

| Motor Type | Rated Current | Target Current (80%) | A4988 Vref | DRV8825 Vref |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|--------------|
| **NEMA 17 (5V, 1.5A)** | 1.5A | 1.2A | 0.96V | 0.60V |
| **NEMA 17 (12V, 1.68A)** | 1.68A | 1.3A | 1.04V | 0.65V |
| **NEMA 17 (12V, 1.2A)** | 1.2A | 1.0A | 0.80V | 0.50V |
| **NEMA 14 (5V, 0.8A)** | 0.8A | 0.64A | 0.51V | 0.32V |

**⚠️ Important:**
- **Always set to 70-80% of motor rated current** to prevent overheating and allow thermal margin
- **Never exceed motor rated current** - this can damage the motor and driver
- **Start low and increase gradually** - it's safer to start at 50% and test
- If motor gets hot to touch (>60°C), reduce current or add cooling

**Quick Check:**
- Motor runs smoothly: Current is good ✅
- Motor skips steps at low speed: Current too low, increase Vref
- Motor/driver overheats: Current too high, decrease Vref
- Motor makes high-pitched noise: Try adjusting microstepping or current

### 4. Servo Rail Voltage Adjustment

**POT_SERVO (Trimmer potentiometer):**
- **Range:** 5V to 10V (adjustable)
- **Default:** ~6V (set at factory, safe for standard servos)
- **Adjustment:** Turn clockwise to increase voltage, counterclockwise to decrease

**How to Set:**
1. Power on the board
2. Measure voltage at servo rail test point (or PCA9685 VCC) with multimeter
3. Adjust potentiometer slowly until desired voltage is reached
4. Common settings:
   - **5-6V:** Standard analog servos
   - **6-7.4V:** High-torque servos
   - **7.4-8.4V:** Digital servos (check servo specs)

**⚠️ WARNING:** Do not exceed servo voltage rating! Most standard servos are rated for 4.8V-6V.

## Usage Guidelines

### Power Budget and Current Limits

**15A Fuse (Default):**
- Adequate for typical operation (2-3 motors running, servos idle)
- **Peak currents** (all motors stalled) can exceed 15A and blow fuse
- Replace fuse with 20A if running heavy-duty applications

**Staggered Motor Startup:**
- Avoid starting all motors simultaneously (reduces inrush current)
- Firmware should implement sequential startup where possible

### H-Bridge Voltage Compatibility

**Default H-Bridge Module (DC5-12V 30A Dual Channel):**
- **Maximum:** 12V (do NOT use with batteries >12V)
- **Minimum:** 5V (battery voltage directly powers motors)

**If using >12V batteries:**
- Replace with BTS7960 H-bridge modules (5-27V rating)
- Or use voltage regulator to step down battery voltage to motor supply

### Arduino Pin Usage Notes

**Serial Ports:**
- **Serial0 (USB):** Programming and debug only
- **Serial2 (pins 16/17):** Reserved for Raspberry Pi communication (do NOT use for other purposes)
- **Serial1 (pins 18/19):** NOT AVAILABLE (used for M2 encoder interrupts)
- **Serial3 (pins 14/15):** NOT AVAILABLE (used for stepper STEP signals)

**PWM Limitations:**
- **Pin 5 (LED_RED):** Digital ON/OFF only (no PWM or breathing - Timer 3 conflict with steppers)
- **Pin 47 (LED_PURPLE):** Digital ON/OFF only (not PWM-capable)

**Interrupt Pins (Rev. B):**
- **INT0 (pin 2):** M1_ENC_A (highest priority)
- **INT1 (pin 3):** M1_ENC_B
- **INT4 (pin 19):** M2_ENC_B
- **INT5 (pin 18):** M2_ENC_A
- **PCINT (pins 11, 12):** M4_ENC_A, M4_ENC_B
- **PCINT (A14, A15):** M3_ENC_A, M3_ENC_B

### Encoder Configuration (Firmware)

**4x Quadrature Mode (All Motors):**
- Motors 1 and 2 (wheels): Full hardware interrupts (INT0-INT5)
- Motors 3 and 4 (manipulators): Pin Change Interrupts (PCINT)
- All motors support full 4x resolution (1440 PPR → 5760 counts/rev)

**Encoder Power:**
- All encoders powered from 5V rail (~20mA each)
- Encoder VCC pins have 100nF decoupling capacitors

## Troubleshooting

### Power Issues

**No LEDs illuminate when power switch is ON:**
- Check fuse is properly seated and not blown (visual inspection)
- Verify battery voltage at XT60 connector with multimeter (should be 7.4V-24V)
- Check power switch is in correct position
- Measure voltage after fuse (should match battery voltage)

**5V power indicator OFF, but battery voltage present:**
- 5V buck converter may have shut down due to overcurrent or thermal protection
- Disconnect all loads (unplug Raspberry Pi, modules)
- Power cycle and check if 5V LED illuminates
- If still off, buck converter may be damaged

**Servo rail indicator OFF:**
- Check servo rail buck converter enable pin (should be pulled high)
- Measure input voltage to buck converter (should match battery)
- Adjust potentiometer and verify output changes (5-10V range)

**Power-good LED behavior:**
- **ON:** 5V power from buck converter (normal)
- **OFF:** 5V backfed from Raspberry Pi USB-C (ideal diode blocking buck)
- **Flickering:** Potential voltage conflict or unstable 5V rail

### Motor Control Issues

**DC motors not responding:**
- Check H-bridge module power connections (V+, GND from battery rail)
- Verify Arduino PWM and direction pins are connected to correct H-bridge inputs
- Measure voltage at H-bridge EN pin (should be PWM signal, 0-5V)
- Test motor directly with bench power supply to rule out motor failure

**Encoders not counting:**
- Check encoder power (5V, GND) at encoder connector
- Verify encoder signal wires (A, B) are connected to correct Arduino pins
- Use oscilloscope to verify encoder generates pulses when motor shaft rotates
- Check firmware ISR handlers are enabled for correct pins

**Steppers not moving:**
- Verify stepper driver module is properly seated in socket
- Check stepper motor coil connections (A+, A-, B+, B-) are correct
- Measure voltage at driver STEP pin (should see pulses when moving)
- Check driver ENABLE pin is LOW (active low enable)
- Verify motor power (VMOT) is present on driver module
- **Check Vref setting:** Too low = no movement, too high = overheating

**Steppers skipping steps:**
- **Current too low:** Increase Vref (motor lacks torque)
- Check for mechanical binding or excessive load
- Reduce acceleration in firmware (slower ramp-up)
- Verify microstepping jumpers are correctly set

**Stepper driver or motor overheating:**
- **Current too high:** Decrease Vref immediately
- Ensure driver heatsink is properly attached
- Add cooling fan if needed
- Verify motor is not mechanically blocked
- Check motor rated current vs Vref setting

**Stepper motor making loud noise:**
- Try different microstepping setting (higher = quieter)
- Adjust Vref (sometimes slight reduction helps)
- Check mechanical alignment of motor shaft
- Reduce STEP pulse frequency in firmware

### Communication Issues

**Arduino-Raspberry Pi UART not working:**
- Check level shifter power (5V on Arduino side, 3.3V on RPi side)
- Verify UART pins: Arduino TX2 (16) → RPi RXD (GPIO15), Arduino RX2 (17) ← RPi TXD (GPIO14)
- Test with loopback: Short TX to RX on one side and send test data
- Check baud rate matches on both sides (115200 or 230400)

**I2C devices not detected:**
- Verify correct Qwiic voltage jumper setting (5V or 3.3V) for your device
- Check I2C pull-up resistors are present (should measure ~2.5V on idle bus)
- Use I2C scanner sketch to detect device addresses
- Verify SDA/SCL are not swapped

**Qwiic connectors not working:**
- Check which bank (A or B) and which bus (Arduino or RPi)
- Arduino banks A and B are on same I2C bus (pins 20/21) - voltage jumpers only affect level shifting
- RPi Qwiic connectors are separate bus (GPIO2/3) - always 3.3V

### LED/Button Issues

**Status LEDs not working:**
- Check Arduino pin assignments in firmware match PCB (see pin table)
- For LED_RED (pin 5): Digital ON/OFF only, PWM disabled due to Timer 3 conflict
- Measure voltage at LED pin (should be 0V when OFF, 5V when ON)

**User buttons not responding:**
- Verify INPUT_PULLUP mode is enabled in firmware
- Check button pins read HIGH when not pressed, LOW when pressed
- Test with multimeter: Measure pin voltage (should be ~5V idle, ~0V pressed)

**Limit switches triggering incorrectly:**
- Check limit switch voltage jumper (JP_LIM_V) matches sensor requirements
- Verify limit switch type (normally-open vs normally-closed)
- Adjust firmware pin mode (INPUT_PULLUP for most sensors)

### Thermal Issues

**Buck converters overheating:**
- Normal: Converters may reach 60-80°C under load (warm to touch)
- Excessive: >100°C indicates problem (too hot to touch)
- Reduce load current or add heatsinks to converter ICs
- Verify thermal vias are connected to bottom ground plane

## Safety Warnings

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION:**

1. **Never hot-plug motors or high-current connections** while board is powered
2. **Always verify voltage settings** before connecting new modules
3. **Do not exceed 15A continuous draw** without upgrading fuse and verifying trace capacity
4. **Ensure proper ventilation** for DC-DC converters under heavy load
5. **Use appropriate wire gauge** for motor power (≥18 AWG for high-current motors)
6. **Keep exposed conductors away from metal chassis** to prevent shorts
